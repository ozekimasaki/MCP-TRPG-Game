An advanced **MCP (Model Context Protocol) powered** TRPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Game) server designed for automated, AI-driven adventures. This project leverages the revolutionary **MCP technology** to seamlessly connect Large Language Models (LLMs) with game mechanics, creating an intelligent AI Keeper (KP) that can dynamically lead, narrate, and manage immersive gaming sessions.

## 🛣️ Roadmap / Future Goals

- [ ] **TRPG MCP Client** — UI for dice, character, multiplayer, and more
- [ ] **Import Your Own Scenarios** — Custom scenario CSV import & editor
- [ ] **Multi-Player Support** — Multiple players, sessions, real-time

## Key Features

- MCP-powered AI Keeper: Automated, intelligent game master
- Rich MCP toolset: Character, scenario, skill, dice, and event management
- Fast character creation and editing
- Flexible scenario and scene system
- Keeper assistant: NPC dialogue, scene description, random events
- Skill, attribute, sanity checks with dice rolling
- Persistent game records (SQLite)
- CSV seed data for easy import
- Modular service architecture
- Instant game start: Just type "I want to start playing TRPG"
- Language: Japanese player-facing narration is supported via prompt/tool localization. Seed data remains Traditional Chinese (zh-TW).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Install .NET 10.0 SDK**
	 - Download and install [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)

2. **MCP-Compatible AI Client** (Optional for enhanced AI integration)
	- Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code with MCP extensions, or other MCP-enabled clients
	- This enables seamless AI interaction with the TRPG server through MCP protocol

### Setup & Launch
3. **Build the Project**
	```
	if you are version 1, please delete ./trpg.db file first
	```
	and
	```powershell
	dotnet build
	```

4. **Run the MCP-Enabled TRPG Server**
	<details open>
	<summary><b>Cursor</b></summary>
	
	Go to: `Settings` -> `Cursor Settings` -> `Tools & MCP`
	You should see trpg-mcp in the list and enable it.
	If you don’t see it, click `New MCP Server` and copy and paste the JSON below.
	```json
	{
		"mcpServers": {
			"trpg-mcp": {
				"type": "stdio",
				"command": "dotnet",
				"args": [
					"run" ,
					"--project",
					"src/ToolBox/ToolBox.csproj",
					"--stdio"
				]
			}
		}
	}
	```
	if you want to use http mode
	```bash
	dotnet run --project src/ToolBox/ToolBox.csproj
	```
	```json
	{
		"mcpServers": {
			"trpg-mcp": {
				"type": "http",
				"url": "http://localhost:5000/mcp"
			}
		}
	}
	```
	
	</details>
	<details open>
	<summary><b>VS Code</b></summary>

	Press `F1` and enter `MCP: List Servers`.  
	You should see **trpg-mcp** in the list—click to start the server.  
	If you don’t see it, press `F1` and enter `MCP: Open User Configuration`, then copy and paste the JSON below.
	```json
	{
		"servers": {
			"trpg-mcp": {
				"type": "stdio",
				"command": "dotnet",
				"args": [
					"run" ,
					"--project",
					"src/ToolBox/ToolBox.csproj",
					"--stdio"
				]
			}
		}
	}
	```

	if you want to use http mode
	```bash
	dotnet run --project src/ToolBox/ToolBox.csproj
	```
	```json
	{
		"servers": {
			"trpg-mcp": {
				"type": "http",
				"url": "http://localhost:5000/mcp"
			}
		}
	}
	```
	</details>

4. **Default Database**
	 - Uses SQLite (`trpg.db`) by default. The database is auto-created on first run.

### Language Configuration
Set the default player-facing language in `appsettings.Local.json`:

```json
"Localization": {
  "DefaultLanguage": "ja-JP"
}
```

Use `ja-JP` for Japanese narration. If you want to revert later, you can change it to `zh-TW`.

5. **API Testing**
	 - Use `MCPTRPGGame.http` for sample API requests and testing.

6. **Quick Game Start with MCP**
   - Players can directly send the command "I want to start playing TRPG" via MCP-enabled clients
   - The AI Keeper instantly accesses game tools through MCP to launch dynamic sessions
